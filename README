   *** README  -  pd_asm_code  *** 

 Just a few simple snippets of assembly code. 
 I want to cover the following areas with these snippets -  

*** Numbers *** 
*  Simple maths operations on integers 
*  Maths operations on floats 
*  Find the minimum and maximum of a few numbers 
*  Find the mean and median of a few numbers  
*  A few examples of using arrays in assembly 

*** Strings *** 
*  Concatenate two strings 
*  Split a string at position "n"  
*  Find the length of a string 
*  Get the first "n" chars of a string 
*  Get the last "n" chars of a string 
*  Get a substring of a string (start at position n, 
       finish at position "m")  
*  Search a string for a substring 
*  Search an array of strings for a given string 
*  Print a given element of an array 
*  Convert a string to uppercase, lowercase, titlecase 

*** Functions *** 
*  A few maths and text functions 

*** Lines *** 
*  Read in a line of text into an array and print the array   
*  Read in several lines, store them and then retrieve them 
   ( maybe using the uparrow key as with shell-history )  
*  Read a "command" and run a function depending on it  

*** Data types *** 
*  Create a function which takes one argument and returns 
     the data-type of that argument (int, float, char, string...) 

*** Other examples *** 
*  Loops, if/then,  switch/case  
*  Simple graphics 
*  Example taking mouse input  


All code here is released to the public-domain.  
"Share and enjoy......."  ;)
